# Sonar
## Self-hosted music streaming service

### The General Idea
Project Sonar - a service that allows users to upload or import music from other services, share tracks and playlists with other users and play the tracks, all using the Web UI.

### The Module Purpose
Our module allows users to upload music either from personal computer directly or from third-party providers such as YouTube, Spotify and others.

### Instructions
